# Inventory Management System (C++)

## Overview
This is a **console-based inventory and sales management system** built in C++ that uses **singly linked lists** to dynamically store and manage product information. 

The system allows you to:
- Add, search, and list products with details such as ID, name, price, and stock.
- Record sales and purchases (restocking), automatically updating inventory and capital.
- Track available capital to ensure purchases do not exceed the budget.
- Efficiently manage inventory using a **linked list**, demonstrating dynamic memory management and linear traversal operations.
